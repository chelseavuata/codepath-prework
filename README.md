## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.

* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
https://www.w3schools.com/html/
https://www.w3schools.com/js/
https://www.w3schools.com/css/

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

A challenge I encountered while creating this submission was overall just understanding the slight changes in syntax while coding in Javascript and HTML. I have never used these languages before and it was a bit difficult to create an entire game in a new language. Some of the things I did to overcome this challenge was researching on both Javascript and HTML tutorials. Utilizing these sites helped me get a better understanding of how Javascript and HTML works all while learning more about them simultaneously. I certainly plan on practicing using these two languages on future personal projects.

Another challenge I encountered while creating this submission was the creation of the “Start” and “Stop” buttons. I was having difficulty hiding one while simultaneously displaying the other one. After re-reading the instructions numerous times and opening the HTML tutorial, I realized that I had incorrectly written the code to hide the buttons. If I didn’t open the HTML tutorial, I would not have realized that I had placed the ‘class="hidden"’ in the incorrect area causing a bug within my code. Once I found that bug, I was more aware of how important the placement of specific lines were while dealing with the 6 buttons in this game.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

After completing my submission, web development is something that has certainly caught my attention. I always planned on taking the software engineering route yet I have always enjoyed creating and designing things in general so web development is something that I can definitely utilize my skills in. Some questions I have about web development would be what coding languages are heavily used while creating? With so much advancement within the world of technology, what does the future of web development look like and how can it advance our modern technology? Lastly, what basic knowledge should I have while entering the world of web development?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had a few more hours to work on this project I would spend time making the game more intricate. Overall, this game was very simplified in order for someone with very little to no experience in HTML, Javascript, and CSS, like me, to create. I would essentially just add more features to make the game more challenging for the player. I would incorporate more buttons that generate sounds along with buttons that do not have sounds. I would create longer sequences for the player to remember and repeat back. Also, I would add a timer feature that would give the player a set amount of time to repeat back the pattern. It would gradually decrease the higher the level gets.
